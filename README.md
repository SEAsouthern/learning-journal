## Growth Mindset

This page will discuss what a growth mindset is and how to use it to succeed in this course. 

### No Fate

_The future's not set. There's no fate but what we make for ourselves."_
-John Connor 

It's cliched but we can do anything we set our mind to. While we might not have the tools now to accomplish a task we have the ability to go and get those tools to create our own future. We don't have to accept current limitations. 

### Nothing to Fear but Fear Itself

_I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain._
-Maud'Dib

Fear of failure is the greatest threat to matching reality to our desires. If we recognize this fear and push through it we can accomplish anything.

### You Can't Do it Alone and You Won't

_I believe that this is a practical world and that I can count
only on what I earn. Therefore, I believe in work, hard work.

_I believe in education, which gives me the knowledge to work
wisely and trains my mind and my hands to work skillfully._

_I believe in honesty and truthfulness, without which I cannot
win the respect and confidence of my fellow men._

_I believe in a sound mind, in a sound body and a spirit that is
not afraid, and in clean sports that develop these qualities._

_I believe in the human touch, which cultivates sympathy with my
fellow men and mutual helpfulness and brings happiness for all._
-Auburn Creed

Through education, introspection, work and friendship we build the toolbox necessary for success.

## Tips for Embracing a Growth Mindset

1. Recognize that you and only you control your fate
2. Embrace your fear of failure and let it pass through you, then move on to the work
3. Build your tool kit. You'll need learn, work, struggle and build support networks
