Computers have four tasks:
    Take input
    Store information
    Process
    Output

Algorithm - Series of commands

Circuts - Binary
    On or off electrical signal
    Represented by 1 or 0

Bit - on or off. Smallest form or information

Everything, numbers, text, video, etc can be expressed in binary. 

Hardware are the physical components of a computer.

Software is all the stuff, programs, etc that run on the hardware. 

CPU is the Central Processing Unit. 

Programming languages covert commands to binary for the CPU to process.

Operating System - Master program that decides what software processes information and commands.
