Local Version Control
    First kind of VCS. Everyone saves version on local computer. Hard for collaboration.
Centralized Version Control
    Hosted on a central server. Easier to collaborate but single point of failure.
Distributed Version Control
    Uses mirroed repositories to both have multiple locations while allowing shared usage and version control.
